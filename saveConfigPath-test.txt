Setting up jest and creating tests takes time. I want to focus on adding
features downside of that approach is I will forget test cases.

- Throws an error when a path is an empty string
- Throws an error when a path is not a string (how to test for non string
  values? there are many non string values)
- Saves path when it points to json file
- Rejects to save path when it points to non json file (how to test for
  non json files? there is too many other extensions)
