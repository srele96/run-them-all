run-them-all run <aliases...>

Handle termination through the use of errors. It may roughly look something like:

run:
  try
    // Throws on failure and terminates flow.
    cli_config = read_file(path)

    // Throws on invalid config.
    validate(cli_config, validator)

    // Throws on failure and terminates flow.
    user_config = read_file(path)

    // Throws on invalid config.
    validate(user_config, validator)

    // Throws if a command is missing and terminates flow.
    commands = get_commands(aliases, config)

    // I don't expect this to throw, but we don't know.
    run-them-all(commands)
  catch error
    print error message
    exit process with code 1
